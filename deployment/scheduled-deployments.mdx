## Turn Tasks into Routines

Scheduled deployments let you run workflows at specific times without manual intervention — hourly, daily, weekly or monthly, with custom schedules.

## Setting Up a Schedule

When deploying a workflow, navigate to the **Schedule Your Workflow** section to configure automatic execution at your preferred intervals.

### Scheduling Options

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose the Right Frequency">
    Match your schedule to your actual needs. Hourly schedules consume more resources — use them only when necessary.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Consider Time Zones">
    Times are set based on your account's timezone. Ensure your chosen time aligns with your target audience or data availability.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Before Scheduling">
    Run your workflow manually first to verify it works correctly before setting up automatic execution.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Performance">
    Check your scheduled workflow runs regularly to ensure they're running successfully and producing expected results.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  You can pause or modify schedules at any time from your deployment settings without having to redeploy the entire workflow.

## From Chat to Automation

Once you've perfected a workflow by watching it run, you can **deploy it to the cloud** to run automatically — no need to keep Maia open or manually trigger execution.

<Note>
  Cloud deployment transforms one-off tasks into **business processes** that run reliably on schedule or on-demand.
</Note>

## Running Workflows Inside the Sessions vs. Deployed

The interface remains the same whether you're actively working with Maia or reviewing automated runs. The difference is in how and when workflows execute.

### Running Inside the Session

**What it means:**
- You initiate the workflow directly in a session
- Watch execution in real-time
- Results delivered when complete

**Best for:**
- Testing new workflows
- One-off research tasks
- Tasks requiring human judgment
- Learning how Maia works

**Example:**
```
"Research the top 5 project management tools and 
create a comparison doc"
```
You watch it run, review results, maybe tweak and re-run.

### Deployed Workflows

**What it means:**
- Workflow runs automatically on schedule or trigger
- No manual initiation required
- You can open any deployment to see execution details
- Results saved in your workspace to access anytime

**Best for:**
- Recurring tasks (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Event-triggered actions (when X happens, do Y)
- Background data processing
- Scaling operations

**Example:**
```
Deploy the "competitor pricing check" workflow to run 
every Monday at 9 AM and send results to #marketing-channel
```
Once you deploy the workflow, it runs automatically every week. You can open the deployment anytime to see execution details and results.

## Deploying a Workflow

There are two ways to deploy a workflow:

### Method 1: Deploy via Chat

Simply tell Maia you want to deploy your workflow, and Maia will suggest the appropriate deployment type with options.

**Example:**
```
"Deploy this workflow to run every Monday morning"
```

Maia will present an interactive suggestion in the chat with:
- Recommended deployment type (scheduled or webhook)
- Pre-configured options based on your request
- A **Deploy** button to review and confirm settings

Click the deploy button in the chat suggestion to review the options and proceed with deployment.

### Method 2: Deploy via Workflow Board

Use the **Deploy workflow** button in the top-right corner of the workflow board.

</Frame>

**Steps:**
1. Click the **Deploy workflow** button in the top-right corner
2. The deployment options panel opens on the right side of the page
3. Choose your deployment method:
   - **Schedule** - Run automatically at specific times or intervals
   - **Create a Webhook** - Trigger via external applications
   - **Create a Trigger** - Run based on specific events or conditions (coming soon)
   - **Create an Action** - Create a custom action from your workflow for Maia (coming soon)
   - **Create a Form** - Collect data and trigger workflow based on submissions (coming soon)

4. Configure the selected deployment type's settings
5. Click **Deploy** to activate

## Deployment Limits by Plan

| Plan Tier | Active Deployments |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Free Plan** | 3 deployments |
| **Plus & Pro Plans** | Unlimited |

<Tip>
  A "deployment" is a unique workflow configuration. Running the same workflow multiple times (e.g., daily) counts as **one** deployment.
</Tip>

## Real-World Deployment Examples

### Example 1: Daily Competitor Monitoring

**Workflow:** Check 10 competitor websites for pricing changes

**Deployment:**
```yaml
Schedule: Daily at 8 AM (Mon-Fri)
Execution: Scrape pricing pages, compare to previous day
Delivery:
  - If changes detected:
      → Email: Alert to pricing@company.com
  - If no changes:
      → No notification (silent success)
```

**Benefit:** Team stays informed of market changes without manual checking

### Example 2: Weekly Lead Enrichment

**Workflow:** Process new leads from Google Form submissions

**Deployment:**
```yaml
Schedule: Every Monday at 9 AM
Execution:
  1. Read form responses from past week
  2. For each lead, research company (web + LinkedIn)
  3. Enrich with: industry, size, tech stack
  4. Add to CRM with enriched data
Delivery:
  - Update CRM records
  - Email summary to sales@company.com
    (# of new leads, top prospects)
```

**Benefit:** Sales team gets qualified, enriched leads without manual research

### Example 3: Monthly Financial Report

**Workflow:** Generate comprehensive financial report

**Deployment:**
```yaml
Schedule: 1st of every month at 6 AM
Execution:
  1. Pull data from accounting software API
  2. Calculate key metrics (revenue, expenses, profit, growth %)
  3. Generate charts (revenue trend, expense breakdown)
  4. Create 20-page PDF report with analysis
Delivery:
  - Save to Drive: "Financial Reports/{{YYYY}}/{{Month}}.pdf"
  - Email to: CFO, CEO, board members
```

**Benefit:** Consistent, professional monthly reporting with zero manual effort

## Execution Logs

Every cloud deployment maintains workflow run logs:

### What's Logged

- **End time**: When execution completed
- **Duration**: How long it took
- **Steps completed**: Which actions ran successfully
- **Errors**: Any failures or issues
- **Results**: Summary of what was produced and what actions were taken

## Closing the Loop

Maia can build web applications that serve as **user-friendly interfaces** to your workflows—turning powerful automations into tools anyone on your team can use.

<Note>
  Imagine giving non-technical team members a simple button that triggers a complex, multi-step AI workflow. That's what Maia-built apps enable.
</Note>

## Why Build Apps for Workflows?

### The Problem with "AI in the Background"

Powerful workflows are great, but if only you know how to trigger them, adoption is limited.

**Without an app:**
- "Can you run that competitor analysis for me?"
- "How do I get that lead enrichment report?"
- Team depends on you to trigger workflows

**With an app:**
- Team visits `https://tools.company.com/competitor-analysis`
- Clicks "Run Analysis"
- Gets results in minutes
- **Self-service automation**

## Building Your First App

### Example: "Generate Report" Button

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the Workflow">
    First, build and test your workflow:
    
    ```
    "Create a workflow that:
    1. Pulls last week's sales data from our CRM
    2. Analyzes trends and top performers
    3. Generates a PDF report
    4. Emails it to the requester"
    ```
    
    Test it to ensure it works.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Build the UI">
    Now create an interface:
    
    ```
    "Build a web app with:
    - A big button labeled 'Generate Weekly Sales Report'
    - When clicked, trigger the sales report workflow
    - Show a loading spinner while it runs
    - Display 'Report sent to your email!' when complete"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect Workflow to App">
    Maia automatically:
    - Creates a webhook for your workflow
    - Connects the button's click event to the webhook
    - Handles response display
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Deploy">
    ```
    "Deploy this app to sales-reports.maia.app"
    ```
    
    **Result:** Live URL accessible to your team
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Share">
    Send the link to your team:
    
    "Anyone can generate the weekly sales report at: 
     https://sales-reports.maia.app"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Form-to-Workflow Apps

### Collecting User Inputs

Build apps that let users customize workflow parameters:

**Example: Custom Competitor Analysis**

**Workflow:**
```
1. Research specified competitors
2. Compare on specified criteria
3. Generate report in requested format
```

**App UI:**
```
Form Fields:
- Competitor Names (text input, comma-separated)
- Comparison Criteria (checkboxes):
  ☐ Pricing
  ☐ Features
  ☐ Customer Reviews
  ☐ Market Share
- Report Format (dropdown): PDF / Google Doc / Email
- Recipient Email (text input)

[Submit Button]
```

**User Experience:**
1. User fills out form
2. Clicks "Submit"
3. Maia triggers workflow with provided parameters
4. Workflow executes with custom inputs
5. User gets confirmation: "Report will be ready in 5-10 minutes"

**Implementation:**
```
"Build a form that collects competitor names, comparison 
criteria, and delivery preferences. When submitted, 
trigger the 'Competitor Analysis' workflow with these 
inputs and show a confirmation message."
```

## Interactive Status Dashboards

### Real-Time Workflow Monitoring

Show users what's happening:

**Example: Content Generation Dashboard**

**UI Components:**
- **Active Workflows**: List of currently running jobs
- **Queue**: Pending requests waiting to execute
- **Recent Completions**: Last 10 finished jobs with links to results
- **Statistics**: Total runs today, average time, success rate

**User Actions:**
- View details of any job
- Cancel running jobs
- Re-run failed jobs
- Download results

**Implementation:**
```
"Create a dashboard that shows:
1. All active 'Blog Post Generation' workflows with progress %
2. A list of completed posts with links
3. Stats on total posts generated this week
4. A button to trigger a new post generation

Connect this to the 'Blog Post Generation' workflow 
and update status in real-time."
```

## Multi-Workflow Apps

### Workflow Orchestration Interface

One app can trigger multiple workflows:

**Example: Marketing Operations Dashboard**

**Dashboard Sections:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Social Media">
    **Actions:**
    - Generate this week's social media posts
    - Schedule posts across platforms
    - Analyze engagement from last week
    
    **Workflows:**
    - `Social_Content_Generator`
    - `Social_Scheduler`
    - `Engagement_Analyzer`
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Email Campaigns">
    **Actions:**
    - Create new email campaign
    - Send to segment
    - View performance metrics
    
    **Workflows:**
    - `Email_Content_Creator`
    - `Campaign_Sender`
    - `Email_Analytics`
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Content Library">
    **Actions:**
    - Generate blog post
    - Create infographic
    - Draft press release
    
    **Workflows:**
    - `Blog_Post_Writer`
    - `Infographic_Generator`
    - `Press_Release_Drafter`
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Reporting">
    **Actions:**
    - Weekly marketing summary
    - Campaign performance report
    - Competitor analysis
    
    **Workflows:**
    - `Weekly_Summary`
    - `Campaign_Reporter`
    - `Competitor_Analysis`
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Result:** One centralized interface for all marketing automation needs.

## Passing Data Between App and Workflow

### App → Workflow (Inputs)

**Simple parameters:**
```javascript
// User clicks button
onClick: {
  triggerWorkflow("competitor_analysis", {
    competitors: ["Company A", "Company B"],
    criteria: ["pricing", "features"]
  })
}
```

**File uploads:**
```javascript
// User uploads invoice PDF
onFileUpload: {
  triggerWorkflow("invoice_processor", {
    file: uploadedPDF,
    vendor: "Acme Corp"
  })
}
```

### Workflow → App (Outputs)

**Display results:**
```javascript
// Workflow completes, returns data
onWorkflowComplete: (result) => {
  displayMessage(result.summary);
  showPDFLink(result.report_url);
  updateDashboard(result.metrics);
}
```

**Stream progress:**
```javascript
// Workflow sends updates while running
onWorkflowProgress: (update) => {
  updateProgressBar(update.percent);
  logMessage(update.status);
}
```

## Authentication & Permissions

### User Login

Restrict app access to authorized users:

```yaml
Authentication: Required
Provider: Google OAuth / Email+Password / SSO

Permissions:
  - admin@company.com: Can trigger all workflows
  - team@company.com: Can view results only
  - external@partner.com: Limited to specific workflows
```

**User Experience:**
1. User visits app URL
2. Prompted to log in
3. Upon success, sees interface appropriate to their role

### Workflow Ownership

When a user triggers a workflow via app:

```yaml
Execution Context:
  Triggered By: user@company.com
  Run As: workflow_owner@company.com
  API Credentials: Owner's connected accounts
  Results Visibility: Both user and owner
```

This ensures workflows use the correct credentials while tracking who initiated them.

## Advanced Features

### Conditional UI

Show/hide elements based on user role or state:

**Example:**
```
"Show the 'Delete Data' button only to users with 
admin@company.com email. For everyone else, hide it."
```

### Dynamic Forms

Forms that adapt based on user input:

**Example:**
```
If user selects "PDF" format:
  Show: Color scheme options
  Hide: Email recipient field

If user selects "Email" format:
  Show: Email recipient field, subject line
  Hide: Color scheme options
```

### Data Tables with Actions

Display data and allow row-level actions:

**Example: Lead Management Dashboard**

| Name | Email | Score | Status | Actions |
|------|-------|-------|--------|---------|
| John Doe | john@ex.com | 85 | New | [Enrich] [Email] |
| Jane Smith | jane@ex.com | 92 | Contacted | [Update] [Schedule] |

Clicking "Enrich" triggers `lead_enrichment` workflow for that specific lead.

### Charts & Visualizations

Integrate data visualization:

```
"Create a dashboard with:
- Line chart showing daily sales over last 30 days
- Pie chart of sales by product category
- Table of top 10 customers by revenue

Pull data from our CRM API and refresh every hour."
```

## Mobile Responsiveness

All Maia-built apps are automatically mobile-friendly:

- **Responsive layouts**: Adapt to screen size
- **Touch-friendly buttons**: Large, easy-to-tap elements
- **Mobile-optimized forms**: Appropriate input types (email keyboard, number pad, etc.)
- **Fast loading**: Optimized assets for mobile networks

## Example: End-to-End Scenario

### The Situation

**Company:** Small marketing agency

**Problem:**
- Clients frequently request competitor analyses
- Currently: Agency manually researches and creates reports (4-6 hours)
- Bottleneck: Only 2 people know how to do it
- Goal: Empower entire team + clients to generate reports

### The Solution

**Step 1: Build the Workflow**
```
"Create a workflow that:
1. Takes competitor names and industry
2. Researches each competitor (website, reviews, pricing)
3. Compares their social media presence
4. Analyzes their content strategy
5. Generates a 15-page PDF report with findings
6. Takes ~10 minutes to complete"
```

**Step 2: Build the App**
```
"Build a web app called 'Competitor Insights Generator':

UI:
- Header: 'Competitor Analysis Report Generator'
- Form fields:
  - Industry (dropdown: SaaS, E-commerce, Healthcare, etc.)
  - Competitor Names (text area, one per line)
  - Your Company Name (text input)
  - Comparison Focus (checkboxes):
    ☐ Pricing Strategy
    ☐ Content Marketing
    ☐ Social Media Presence
    ☐ Product Features
  - Email for Delivery (text input)
- Big 'Generate Report' button

Style: Clean, professional, branded with our colors
```

**Step 3: Deploy**
```
"Deploy this app to:
- URL: insights.agency.com
- Accessible to: team@agency.com domain + specific client emails
- Trigger workflow on form submit
- Show progress: 'Researching... this takes about 10 minutes'
- On complete: Send email with PDF + show download link"
```

### The Result

**Before:**
- Client requests analysis → Assigned to specialist → 4-6 hours of work → Delivered manually

**After:**
- Client visits `insights.agency.com` → Fills form (2 minutes) → Submits → Gets report via email in 10 minutes

**Impact:**
- **Time saved**: 4-6 hours → 10 minutes (96% reduction)
- **Scalability**: Unlimited analyses, no human bottleneck
- **Quality**: Consistent, comprehensive, professional
- **Client satisfaction**: Instant gratification
- **Monetization**: Can charge for access or per-report

## App Analytics

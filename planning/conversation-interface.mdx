## Talking to Maia

Maia's interface is designed for natural conversation. You don't need to learn special commands or syntax — just describe what you need in your own words.

## How the Interface Works

Everything happens in the same chat interface. When you describe what you need, Maia collaborates with you through conversation to understand your requirements and define the workflow. As Maia starts planning your solution, a board view appears on the right side, visualizing the workflow steps.

**During the conversation, you can:**
- Discuss requirements and goals
- Develop and refine strategy
- Review the visual workflow on the board
- Ask questions and provide clarifications
- Request adjustments based on your needs
- Approve the plan when ready

**Example conversation:**
```
You: I need to track customer feedback from emails
Maia: I can help with that. Should I:
      1. Monitor a specific email inbox?
      2. Look for particular keywords or senders?
      3. Store the feedback in a spreadsheet?
You: Yes, monitor support@mybakery.com for emails 
     with "feedback" or "suggestion" in the subject
Maia: Got it. I'll create a workflow that checks 
     that inbox, filters by those keywords, and 
     logs entries to a Google Sheet. Would you like 
     to run this once or schedule it regularly?
```

**Once you approve the plan:**
- The workflow executes in real-time
- You see progress updates in the chat
- The board view shows which agents are working on what
- Results are generated and delivered
- Errors are handled and communicated

**During execution, you can:**
- Monitor progress in real-time
- Pause execution if needed
- Provide additional context mid-run

## Describing Your Manual Process

The best way to get Maia to automate something is to describe how you currently do it manually.

💬 _Right now, I go to our G2.com company page every Friday. 
I scroll through new reviews, copy any that mention 
specific features, paste them into a Google Doc, and 
then email the doc to our product team with a summary 
of common themes._

✅ **Maia understands:**
  - Where to find information (G2.com)
  - What to look for (feature mentions)
  - Where to store it (Google Doc)
  - Who needs it (product team via email)
  - When to do it (weekly on Friday)

<br/>

💬 _I need to monitor our G2 reviews and share relevant 
feedback with the product team weekly._

✅ **Maia will ask:**
  - Which reviews are "relevant"?
  - How should the feedback be formatted?
  - Any specific team members to notify?
  - Preferred delivery method?

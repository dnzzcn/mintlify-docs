## Live Web Intelligence (Search)

Most AI models are limited by what they learned during their training, which might be months or even years old. Maia breaks these limits by connecting directly to the live internet.

When you ask Maia a question that requires current knowledge, like "What is the latest news on AI regulations?" or "Find the current CEO of this company", it doesn't rely on memory. It performs a real-time investigation.

### Simultaneous Multi-Phrase Search

A human researcher usually searches for one thing at a time: they type a query, scan the results, refine the query, and try again. This is slow and linear.

Maia is a parallel thinker. It can generate and execute multiple search phrases simultaneously to gather a complete picture in seconds.

**Example:** If you ask, "How does our product's pricing compare to our top 3 competitors?"

- **Human approach:** Search Competitor A, write down price. Search Competitor B, write down price. Search Competitor C...

- **Maia's approach:** Maia simultaneously launches searches for "Competitor A pricing", "Competitor B pricing", and "Competitor C pricing".

It retrieves results from across the web instantly, filters for the most relevant snippets, and synthesizes the up-to-date information into a single clear answer. This ensures your automations are always powered by the freshest data available.

### Location & Maps Search

Maia's intelligence also extends to the physical world. It can perform Maps searches to retrieve location-specific information.

You don't need to do anything special to activate this, just ask a question in plain language. Whether you need to find nearby businesses, analyze region-based data, or understand the context of a specific place, Maia handles it automatically.

**How it works:** If you ask Maia to "Find the top-rated Italian restaurants within walking distance of the convention center," it will research the area, analyze the relevant details (like ratings, distance, and hours), and return accurate, actionable insights just like it does with standard web search.

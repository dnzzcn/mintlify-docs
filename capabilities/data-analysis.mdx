## Execute Code On Demand

Maia can write and execute code in real-time to solve complex problems, perform calculations, and transform data — all within your workflow.

## Why Data Analysis Matters

### Trustworthy Mathematical Operations

When precision is critical, Maia generates and executes code to guarantee accurate results:

**Example:**
```
Calculate the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for a portfolio 
that started at $100,000 and grew to $175,000 over 5 years.
```

Instead of estimating, Maia generates and executes Python code to return the precise result: **11.84%**.

## Data Visualization

Maia creates professional visualizations from any data source — whether you provide it directly or Maia retrieves it from the web or connected platforms.

## Your Data Analysis Teammate

Data analysis transforms Maia into a powerful analytical partner:

✅ **Process large datasets** - Handle thousands of rows efficiently  
✅ **Perform statistical analysis** - Correlations, regressions, hypothesis testing  
✅ **Generate insights** - Identify trends, outliers, and patterns  
✅ **Create reports** - Combine analysis with visualizations in documents  
✅ **Automate calculations** - Build workflows that run complex math operations

  <Accordion title="Example: Sales Performance Analysis">
    **Request:**
    ```
    I have Q4 sales data in this CSV. Analyze it and show me:
    - Total revenue by month
    - Top 5 products by units sold
    - Average deal size by sales rep
    - Month-over-month growth rate
    
    Create visualizations for each metric.
    ```
    
    **What Maia Does:**
    1. Reads and validates the CSV data
    2. Executes Python code to calculate each metric
    3. Generates four separate chart visualizations (line chart for revenue, bar chart for products, etc.)
    4. Creates a summary table with key statistics
    5. Provides numerical summaries alongside charts
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Example: Financial Modeling">
    **Request:**
    ```
    Calculate the break-even point for a SaaS product with:
    - Monthly fixed costs: $50,000
    - Variable cost per customer: $5/month
    - Subscription price: $99/month
    
    Show me break-even in customers and create a graph showing 
    profitability from 0 to 1,000 customers.
    ```
    
    **What Maia Does:**
    1. Generates a financial model in code
    2. Calculates break-even: **532 customers**
    3. Creates a line graph showing the profitability curve
    4. Highlights the break-even point on the visualization
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Example: Data Enrichment & Visualization">
    **Request:**
    ```
    Get the last 30 days of Bitcoin prices, calculate the daily 
    percentage change, and create a chart showing the price 
    movement with volume bars below.
    ```
    
    **What Maia Does:**
    1. Retrieves historical Bitcoin data from a financial API
    2. Calculates daily price changes programmatically
    3. Generates a professional price chart with OHLC data
    4. Adds volume bars as a subplot
    5. Returns insights about volatility and trends

## Computer Use: Beyond Text Scraping

Maia doesn't just read websites, it can **use** them. The Secure Browser gives Maia the ability to click, scroll, type, and navigate websites exactly like you would.

<Note>
  This is **computer use** technology: Maia sees the screen, understands visual elements, and takes actions just like you do with your browser.

## How It Works

### Visual Understanding

The browser doesn't use hidden APIs or HTML parsing. It sees the page as you do:

1. **Takes a screenshot** of the current view
2. **Analyzes the visual layout** (buttons, text, images)
3. **Identifies interactive elements** (clickable areas)
4. **Plans the next action** (what to click or type)
5. **Executes the action** and observes the result

This means Maia can interact with any website, even complex single-page applications that make traditional scraping difficult.

### Example: Applying to Y Combinator

**Your request:**

💬 _Apply to Y Combinator's next batch for my startup, 
using information from our pitch deck and business plan._

**What Maia does:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Application">
    Opens YC's application portal and starts a new application
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Visual Analysis">
    Identifies all form fields, text areas, and dropdown menus
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Extract & Fill Company Info">
    From your documents, fills in:
    - Company name and description
    - Founder details and equity split
    - Product/market fit explanation
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Handle Complex Questions">
    For essay questions like "What's new about your solution?", synthesizes answers from your pitch deck
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit">
    Reviews all entries, clicks submit, and confirms submission
  </Step> 
</Steps>

## Using the Secure Browser Session

When Maia needs to access a platform that requires authentication, it will prompt you to establish a secure browser session.

### Starting a Secure Session

<Steps>
  <Step title="Maia Detects Login Required">
    When your workflow needs access to a platform (like LinkedIn, your CRM, or accounting software), Maia will notify you that authentication is needed.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Interactive Browser Prompt">
    Maia presents an interactive button that opens the website directly in Maia's secure browser. Simply click to navigate to the login page.

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="You Log In Securely">
    Enter your credentials in the secure browser window, just as you would normally. Your login details are air-gapped from the AI system.
    <Frame><img src="/images/logged_in_to_instagram.jpg" alt="Secure Browser Logged In"  noZoom/></Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Session Established">
    Once logged in, the session is saved. You can close the browser window, and Maia can begin using this authenticated session to execute your workflow.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Maia Continues Automatically">
    When the workflow runs, Maia's browser picks up the session and continues from where you left off, already logged in and ready to work.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
You only need to log in once per platform. The session remains active until you manually log out from that platform yourself.
</Note>

## Security & Privacy: Your Credentials Stay Safe

Granting an AI access to your accounts requires trust. We built Maia's browser environment with a primary goal: absolute security for your login details.

### The Zero-Trust Approach

In simple terms, "Zero Trust" means Maia is designed to treat everything, and everyone, as potentially insecure. This is the opposite of the old way, where once you were logged in, everything was trusted.

**With Maia:**

- Maia is trusted to do the work.
- Maia is never trusted with your secrets (passwords).

This core principle means your sensitive information is isolated from the AI processes.

### How Your Login Details Are Isolated (The Air-Gap)

Think of your password and the AI as being separated by a solid wall, an "air gap." They can never touch.

1. **You Log In (Your Action)**: When a task requires authentication (like accessing your LinkedIn or your accounting portal), Maia will ask you to log in via a secure, private browser window. You type the credentials into the web page, just like you normally would.

2. **Your Credentials Never Reach Our Servers**: Your username and password are entered directly into the website you're logging into. They never pass through Maia's systems and are never stored anywhere on our servers.

3. **The Session Token (The Access Pass)**: Once you successfully log in, the website issues a session token and cookies, think of these as digitally "signed documents" that grant temporary access rights. These are the only things we store.

4. **Maia Works with the Access Pass**: When Maia runs a workflow, it uses these session tokens and cookies to access the website on your behalf. The AI agents enter the website already authenticated, ready to work, just like when you return to a website and find yourself still logged in.

5. **You Control the Access**: The session remains active until you manually log out from that platform yourself. When you log out, those "access passes" are revoked, and Maia can no longer access that account.

<Note>
**Crucial Guarantee**: The AI models that execute the workflow only see the screen content (the visual data, the dashboard, the reports). It is technically impossible for the AI to access or read your actual login credentials, as those credentials were never passed to the system in the first place.
</Note>

### Ethical Use

Maia's power comes with responsibility:
- **Don't spam**: Automate outreach, but keep it reasonable
- **Don't abuse**: Respect rate limits and fair use
- **Don't violate privacy**: Only access data you're authorized to see
- **Don't harm**: Avoid actions that could overload or harm websites

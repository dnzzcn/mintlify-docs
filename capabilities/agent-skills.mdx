## Give Maia New Capabilities

Agent Skills allow you to package specialized knowledge, workflows, and domain expertise into reusable capabilities that Maia can discover and use automatically. Whether you need brand guidelines enforcement, custom analysis pipelines, or company-specific procedures, skills give Maia the context it needs to work reliably.

## What are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills are a simple, open format for extending AI agents with specialized capabilities. A skill is a folder containing instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can load on demand when relevant to a task.

The format is built on three principles:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Self-Documenting" icon="book">
    Skills are human-readable folders with markdown instructions
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Portable" icon="box">
    Use the same skill across different AI agents and platforms
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Progressive" icon="layer-group">
    Load only what's needed, keeping context efficient
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### The Agent Skills Standard

Each skill contains a `SKILL.md` file with:
- **Metadata**: Name and description (so Maia knows when to use it)
- **Instructions**: Step-by-step guidance in markdown format
- **Optional Resources**: Scripts, templates, reference documents, and assets

This open format means skills you create for Maia can work with other skills-compatible agents like Claude AI, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and OpenAI Codex.

## How Maia Uses Agent Skills

Maia integrates Agent Skills using a progressive disclosure approach:

1. **Discovery**: At startup, Maia loads the name and description of all your skills
2. **Activation**: When a task matches a skill's description, Maia loads the full instructions
3. **Execution**: Maia follows the instructions, accessing scripts and resources as needed

This keeps Maia fast while giving it access to extensive specialized knowledge on demand.

### Automatic Integration

Unlike other AI agents that require manual skill installation, **all skills in Maia are immediately available across**:

- ✓ All conversation sessions
- ✓ All workflows (including existing ones)
- ✓ All deployed automations
- ✓ All scheduled executions

No configuration, no restarts, no installation steps. Create a skill and Maia can use it instantly.

## Example: Creating a Brand Guidelines Skill

Here's how Maia structures a complete Agent Skills package:

```
brand-guidelines/
├── SKILL.md              # Main instructions with metadata
├── references/
│   ├── colors.md        # Detailed color specifications
│   ├── typography.md    # Font usage rules
│   └── examples.md      # Good and bad examples
└── assets/
    ├── logo-primary.svg # Logo files
    └── logo-white.svg
```

The `SKILL.md` file contains:

```markdown
---
name: brand-guidelines
description: Enforces company brand guidelines including logo usage, color palette, typography, and visual style rules. Use when generating any marketing materials, presentations, or public-facing content.
---

# Brand Guidelines

## When to use this skill
Use this skill whenever creating or reviewing:
- Marketing materials
- Social media content
- Presentations
- Website copy
- Email campaigns

## Logo Usage
Always use the primary logo (#39DA5D) on white backgrounds.
Use the white logo on dark backgrounds (#1A1A1A or darker).

Never:
- Stretch or distort the logo
- Add effects (shadows, gradients, outlines)
- Place on busy backgrounds

## Color Palette
Primary: #39DA5D (Maia Green)
Secondary: #1A1A1A (Charcoal)
...
```

When you ask Maia to "create a social media post," it automatically:
1. Recognizes the task matches the brand guidelines skill
2. Loads the full instructions
3. Applies your specific brand rules
4. Generates compliant content

<Tip>
**Quick Start**: Try creating a skill for your brand's tone of voice. Include 3-5 key principles and some example phrases to use and avoid. Within seconds, Maia will apply this guidance to all content generation.

## Your First Workflow

Let's walk through a practical example that showcases Maia's capabilities: researching CRM tools and creating a comparison document.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a Conversation">
    Open Maia and describe what you need:
    
    ```
    Research the top 5 CRM tools for a bakery business 
    and create a comparison PDF with pricing and key features.
    ```
    
    Maia will acknowledge your request and start building a strategy.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review the Plan">
    Maia presents a visual workflow showing:
    
    - **Web Research**: Search for "best CRM for bakeries"
    - **Data Collection**: Visit product pages and gather information
    - **Comparison Analysis**: Structure findings into a table
    - **Document Generation**: Create a styled PDF presentation
    
    You'll see each step connected in a logical flow.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Execute">
    If you have already provided enough detail, Maia will automatically run the workflow. Otherwise, you can confirm by saying something like:
    
    ```
    Looks great! Run it.
    ```

    or using the "Run Workflow" button, located bottom left corner of the board.
    
    Maia will then begin execution. You'll see real-time updates as each agent:
    - Searches multiple sources simultaneously
    - Extracts relevant information
    - Compiles comparison data
    - Generates your PDF
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Results">
    Within minutes, you'll receive:
    
    - A polished PDF comparison document you can download
    - Source links for verification
    - A workflow you can run again, or deploy for scheduled automation
  </Step>
</Steps>

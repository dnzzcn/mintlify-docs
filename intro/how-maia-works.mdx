## The Core Loop

Maia follows a simple but powerful four-step process to turn your goals into completed work:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe Your Goal">
    Tell Maia what you want to accomplish in plain language. Be as detailed as you'd be when explaining a task to a colleague.
    
    ```
    "Research the top 5 CRM tools for a bakery business, 
    compare their pricing and features, and create a 
    presentation I can share with my team."
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Maia Builds a Strategy">
    Maia analyzes your request and creates a comprehensive plan. It identifies:
    - What information needs to be gathered
    - Which tools and integrations to use
    - How to break the work into parallel tasks
    - The optimal sequence of operations
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Visual Workflow Creation">
    Your strategy becomes a visual workflow: a step-by-step diagram showing exactly what Maia will do. You can:
    - See the plan before it runs
    - Understand the logical flow
    - Make adjustments if needed
    - Learn how the process works
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Autonomous Execution">
    Maia executes the workflow, orchestrating multiple specialized agents to work in parallel. You can:
    - Watch the work happen in real-time
    - See results as they're generated
    - Deploy for future automation
  </Step>
</Steps>

## From Manual to Automated

The key to getting great results from Maia is describing your current manual process:

<CodeGroup>
```text Good Example
"I usually visit G2.com and search for CRM software. 
Then I open each product page, scroll down to find 
pricing, and copy the details into a spreadsheet. 
After comparing 5-10 options, I create a presentation 
with screenshots and my notes."
```
</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup>
```text Also Works
"Compare popular CRM tools for bakeries and create 
a presentation with pricing and features."
```
</CodeGroup>

The more detail you provide about your current workflow, the better Maia can optimize and automate it.

## Intelligent Adaptation

Maia doesn't just follow a script—it adapts during execution:

- **Dynamic Decision Making**: Adjusts approach based on what it discovers
- **Error Recovery**: Handles unexpected situations automatically
- **Parallel Processing**: Scales up agents when beneficial

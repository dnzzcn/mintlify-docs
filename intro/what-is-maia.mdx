## More Than a Chatbot

Maia is a **general-purpose AI assistant** designed to work alongside you as an autonomous teammate. Unlike chatbots that simply answer questions, Maia plans and executes complex workflows to get real work done.

## The Multi-Model Advantage

Maia isn't just one AI agent — it's a sophisticated **manager** that orchestrates multiple state-of-the-art AI models to deliver the best results.

Under the hood, it orchestrates AI agents powered by **Gemini 3 Pro**, **Claude Opus 4.5**, and **GPT 5.2**, assigning each taks to the model best suited for the job.

Each task is automatically routed to the agent that will perform it best, giving you the combined strengths of the world's leading AI models.

## Massively Multi-Agent Chain-of-Thought

At its core, Maia uses a revolutionary approach called **massively multi-agent chain-of-thought**:

1. **Thinks**: Analyzes your request and understands the goal
2. **Plans**: Breaks down complex tasks into semantic steps
3. **Delegates**: Assigns each sub-task to specialized agents
4. **Executes**: Coordinates multiple agents working in parallel

This means Maia can handle work that would normally require a team of specialists, from research and data analysis to document creation and web automation.

## Built for Everyone

Whether you're a small business owner automating repetitive tasks or a developer building custom workflows, Maia adapts to your level of technical expertise:

- **No-code interface** for business users
- **Visual workflows** for process optimization
- **Custom integrations** for developers
- **Flexible deployment** options for any scale

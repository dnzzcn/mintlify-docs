## Security First

Maia handles sensitive business data and credentials. Security and privacy are fundamental to every aspect of the platform.

<Note>
  Your data is **your data**. Maia processes it only as needed for your workflows and **never** uses it to train AI models or share with third parties.
</Note>

## Data Handling Principles

### 1. Isolation

**Your data is completely isolated:**
- Each account operates in a separate, encrypted environment
- No data leakage between customers
- Even ModularMind staff cannot access your data without explicit permission

### 2. Transient Processing

**Data is not stored permanently:**
- AI models process data **in memory** during workflow execution
- Only results are stored in your workspace
- Unless you explicitly ask Maia to send it to an external database, processed data is discarded after execution

### 3. No Training Data

<Warning>
  **Critical:** Your data is **NEVER** used to train AI models.
</Warning>

When Maia uses GPTs, Claude, or Gemini:
- Data is sent to these services for processing
- Maia uses enterprise agreements with these providers that **prohibit training** on customer data
- Your workflows and data remain confidential



## Credential Security

### Browser Session Storage

Maia's "Secure Browser" capability uses **air-gapped credentials**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="You Log In">
    You authenticate to a website (e.g., Gmail, LinkedIn) in a secure browser session
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Session Stored">
    The **session cookies** (not your password) are encrypted and stored
    
    **Encryption:** AES-256 encryption at rest
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Maia Uses Session">
    When workflows need access, Maia uses the stored session
    
    **AI Model Sees:** Only the rendered screen (visual pixels)
    **AI Model Does NOT See:** Cookies, passwords, authentication tokens
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="You Control">
    You can revoke stored sessions anytime from your Maia settings
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Key Point:** Maia uses your authenticated session, but the AI model only sees the screen output — like watching someone use a computer, not reading their password manager.

### OAuth Tokens

When you authorize Maia to access services:

1. **Standard OAuth 2.0 flow** (same as "Login with Google")
2. **Tokens stored encrypted**
3. **Automatic refresh** when tokens expire
4. **Revocable** from service provider

## Network Security

### Infrastructure

Maia runs on enterprise-grade infrastructure:

- **AWS / GCP**: Industry-leading cloud providers
- **Private VPCs**: Isolated network environments
- **Firewalls**: Restrict access to authorized traffic only
- **DDoS Protection**: Provider-level protection

## Privacy & Compliance

### GDPR Compliance

For EU customers:

✅ **Right to Access**: Download all your data  
✅ **Right to Erasure**: Delete all data on request  
✅ **Data Portability**: Export in standard formats  
✅ **Consent Management**: Clear consent for data processing  
✅ **Data Processing Agreement**: Available for enterprise customers  


## Incident Response

### Monitoring

Maia's security team monitors for:
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Unusual API activity
- Data exfiltration attempts
- Service disruptions

### Breach Notification

In the unlikely event of a security breach:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Detection">
    Automated systems + security team identify issue
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Containment">
    Immediate action to stop unauthorized access
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Notification">
    Affected customers notified within **72 hours**
    
    Email includes:
    - What happened
    - What data was affected
    - What we're doing about it
    - What you should do
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Remediation">
    Fix vulnerability, enhance security
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Post-Mortem">
    Public transparency report (if appropriate)
  </Step>
</Steps>

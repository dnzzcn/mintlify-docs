## Smart Tool Selection

Maia doesn't require you to manually specify which connections to use. It intelligently selects the right actions based on your intent.

<Note>
  Think of it like talking to a skilled assistant who knows which tools to reach for — you describe the outcome, not the implementation.

## Suggested Actions vs. Available Actions

### Suggested Actions

When building a workflow, Maia **suggests** actions for AI agents based on your request:

**Your Request:**
```
"Retrieve Instagram posts from my feed, generate a similar
image for posting,and email me it as an attachment."
```

**Maia's suggested actions for the prompt:**
- Generate Image: Create an image using Nano Banana Pro
- Gmail: Send email with attachment

These suggestions appear in the workflow visualization before execution.

### Available Actions (Dynamic Discovery)

During execution, if Maia encounters a situation not covered by the plan, it **searches its action library** for solutions:

**Scenario:**
- Planned action: "Read the report from Dashboard"
- Problem: Dashboard requires 2FA code
- **Dynamic discovery**: Maia searches for "Get 2FA code" actions
- **Finds**: Gmail action to read 2FA code from email
- **Executes**: Reads code, completes authentication, proceeds with download

**Result:** Workflow adapts without manual intervention

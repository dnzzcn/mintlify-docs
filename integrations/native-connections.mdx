## Seamless Tool Connection

Maia integrates natively with popular business applications, allowing workflows to read, write, and manage data across your existing tools.

You don't need to manually configure "nodes" or "connectors." Just tell Maia what you need, and it automatically uses the right connection.

## How Connections Work

### One-Time Authorization

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Use">
    When you mention a tool for the first time:
    ```
    "Check my Gmail for messages from customers"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="OAuth Flow">
    Maia prompts you to authorize access via standard OAuth

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Grant Permissions">
    You approve the specific permissions Maia needs (e.g., "Read Gmail messages")
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save Token">
    Your authorization is encrypted and stored securely
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Future Use">
    Maia automatically uses the saved authorization — no repeated logins needed
  </Step>
</Steps>
 
Optionally, you can have a look at available connections through Connections settings in your Maia workspace, and connect your accounts there as well.

### Automatic Action Selection

You don't specify action use, Maia infers what you need:

<Tab title="You Say">
  ```
  "Read emails from support@customer.com, 
  add a row to the 'Customer Feedback' Google Sheet 
  with the sender, subject, and date."
  ```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Maia Understands">
  1. Gmail: Search inbox
  2. Gmail: Filter by sender
  3. Gmail: Extract subject and date
  4. Google Sheets: Find 'Customer Feedback' sheet
  5. Google Sheets: Append new row
</Tab>

## Privacy & Data Access

<Warning>
  **Important:** Maia only accesses data needed for your specific workflows. The AI model processes data transiently — nothing is stored permanently without your explicit instruction.
</Warning>

### What Maia Can See
- Only data from authorized accounts
- Only during workflow execution
- Only for the specific task requested

### What Maia Cannot See
- Data from non-authorized accounts
- Information outside the workflow scope
- Historical data after workflow completes

### Your Controls
- Revoke access anytime
- Audit responses show what was accessed

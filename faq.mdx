<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I change plans anytime?">
    Yes, upgrade anytime (takes effect immediately). Downgrade at end of billing period.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if I exceed deployment limits?">
    You can't create new deployments but existing ones keep running. Upgrade to add more.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do unused deployments roll over?">
    Deployment limits are concurrent (not cumulative), so there's nothing to "roll over."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I purchase additional deployments without upgrading?">
    Not currently, but Enterprise plans offer unlimited deployments. Contact sales for custom solutions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is there a pay-as-you-go option?">
    Not yet, but planned for future release. Currently, choose a plan that fits your needs.
